Creating an EVM-Subnet on Avalanche
Overview
This project establishes an EVM Subnet on the Avalanche network named "Ajidokwu," featuring its native token, GamersTokens (AJI). The network seamlessly integrates with MetaMask, enabling the deployment and interaction with smart contracts through the injected provider on Remix.

Project Features
These project will be interacting with two smart contracts an ERC20 token and a vault contract, these contracts should be able to:

Token Creation: Deploy your own ERC-20 token with customizable details such as name, symbol, and decimals.

Token Transfers: Users can transfer tokens to other addresses with ease, following the widely adopted ERC-20 standard.

Token Minting: The contract owner has the ability to mint new tokens, expanding the total token supply.

Token Burning: Users can burn their own tokens, reducing the overall token supply etc.
